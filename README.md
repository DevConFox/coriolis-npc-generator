# Coriolis NPC Generator

Coriolis NPC Generator is a simple Foundry VTT module that generates an NPC name and profession.

Once installed, you can drag and drop the macro from the compendium to your hotbar.

After that, you can click the macro to get the NPC information in the chat window (whispered to GM only).

This was based on https://rwinslow.github.io/#coriolis-npcs.
